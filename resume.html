        alt="Elaina in 2022 celebrating her Graduation from St. Thomas" height="250" style="float: right;">
    <p>In 2022 I graduated from the University of St Thomas with a degree in English with a focus in creative writing,
        and in 2023 I started at St Catherine University. </p>
    <p>I have worked at the Minneapolis Central library, first as a volunteer working with the city pages collection,
        where I rehoused photographs with better organization, documented all the photographers and image content,
        researched image content to further organize and sort, and discarded unnecessary images in the collection. This
        transitioned into paid work where I worked with the neighborhood collections, sorting through the available
        mixed materials such as receipts, flyers, photographs, paperwork, CDâ€™s and even floppy disks, filing into new
        folders with content descriptions, and creating finding aids for each neighborhood.</p>
    <p>I have also taken classes at the Minnesota Center for Book arts to learn more about books and how to take care of
        them while working towards certification. I have learned how traditional European paper was made, and how books,
        both modern and antique, can be cleaned and repaired to reenter circulation</p>
